# CppCompile: 12-Week Accelerated C++ Compiler Developer Guide

## 🎯 Goal

To gain the foundational C++ systems knowledge, modern design patterns, and initial LLVM/MLIR exposure required to contribute to or build a sophisticated compiler or high-performance toolchain.

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents an intensive **12-week, 26-hour-per-week** learning sprint focused on:

- **Modern C++** (C++17/20)
- **Low-level memory management**
- **Compiler infrastructure** (Lexer, Parser, AST, and early MLIR concepts)

This resource aims to be the go-to guide for anyone transitioning from basic programming to systems-level C++ development.

## 📚 Syllabus Overview

This accelerated timeline is divided into three focused phases:

| Phase | Focus Area | Duration |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | C++ Fundamentals & System Core | Weeks 1-4 |
| **Phase 2** | Advanced C++ & Design Patterns | Weeks 5-8 |
| **Phase 3** | Compiler Foundations & Project Jumpstart | Weeks 9-12 |

## 📁 Repository Structure

The files are organized to separate notes, runnable code examples, and videos for optimal learning experience:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`/Code`** | Contains all runnable C++ examples, organized by week and day (e.g., `w1_d1`, `w12_project`). Each folder includes a `CMakeLists.txt` |
| **`/Notes`** | Contains detailed notes, concepts, diagrams, and summaries of complex topics like RAII or the Visitor Pattern |
| **`/Projects`** | Contains larger, multi-file assignments (e.g., the final Lexer/Parser) |
| **`/Videos`** | Short, self-recorded clips explaining a concept or troubleshooting a specific bug—a quick reference for future learners organised in a weekly manner |
| **`/Extras`** | Extra interesting things, including but not limited to articles, research papers, videos, open-source codes, frame-works, etc. |
| **`README.md`** | This file |
