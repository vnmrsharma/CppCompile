CppCompile: 12-Week Accelerated C++ Compiler Developer Guide

Goal: To gain the foundational C++ systems knowledge, modern design patterns, and initial LLVM/MLIR exposure required to contribute to or build a sophisticated compiler or high-performance toolchain.

This repository aims to documents an intensive 12-week, 26-hour-per-week learning sprint focused on modern C++ (C++17/20), low-level memory management, and compiler infrastructure (Lexer, Parser, AST, and early MLIR concepts).

This resource aims to be the go-to guide for anyone transitioning from basic programming to systems-level C++ development.

Syllabus Overview 
This accelerated timeline is divided into three focused phases.
Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals & System Core (Weeks 1-4)
Phase 2: Advanced C++ & Design Patterns (Weeks 5-8)
Phase 3: Compiler Foundations & Project Jumpstart (Weeks 9-12)
